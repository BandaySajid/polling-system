### Assignment - Polling System with Kafka, Zookeeper & Real-Time Features

### Setup

- I have included .env for this project, so this should be noted.

## requirements:

    - docker

- ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```

## Test and run:

- Go to localhost:9991
  # Create Poll:
  - Create a poll, add a question and options(one per line)
  - the new poll will show up.
  # Vote for poll:
  - Click on 'View Results' and keep the page on side to see realtime updates.
  - On the root page, the options will have appeared, click on any option and the vote will be added.
  - I have not added functionality to differentiate users, so each click will be added as a vote.
